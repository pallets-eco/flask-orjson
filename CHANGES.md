## Version 2.0.1

Unreleased

- Fallback to the builtin `json`-library when an `object_hook` is passed to `.loads`
  since `orjson` cannot handle this. This ensures full compatibility and correct
  serialization with `get_flashed_messages(with_categories=True)`.

## Version 2.0.0

Released 2024-01-14

- Simplify how the library is used and configured.
- The `ORJSON` extension class is removed. Use `app.json = OrjsonProvider(app)`.
- `OrjsonProvider` has `option` and `default` attributes, or `dumps` takes them
  as keyword arguments.
- The provider does not have `sort_keys` or `compact` as arguments or
  attributes. Use `option` to set the relevant orjson flags instead.
- The `__version__` attribute is removed. Call `importlib.metadata.version` instead.
- `datetime` objects without a timezone (naive) use UTC.
- Export type annotations.
- Change license to MIT.
- Use PyPI trusted publishing.
- Use `src` directory layout.
